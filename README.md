## What it is
The idea is to have several concurrent timers and stopwatches going.  

Features:
* Set the amount manually
* Have a timer play either forwards or backward
* Affect all timers with one button
	* Play all
	* Pause all
	* Reset all
	* Remove all
* Create a Pomodoro timer

## Credits
You could look at the package.json, but I wanted to call out the things I installed on purpose.  
* This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app).
	* This, of course, installed a bunch of junk like Jest, WebPack, etc.
* Font Awesome
* Styled Components
* GitHub Pages
